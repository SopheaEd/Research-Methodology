- Location
- Target population
- Sample size
- Number of sampling

__Study sites selection__
- names all study sites
- list all number of population for each site
- cumulative sampling
- calculate  interval sampling: $ints = \frac{total_cumulative_sampling}{targeted_site}$
- calculate random sampling
- site selection 1
- select the next site

Random site selection is used when we want to evaluate and compare result. 

___The target population__
- decide target population
- purposes of the study
- representiveness
  - sample size
  - selection methods
 
__Calculate sample size__
- cost
- labor

- 50-100 can use not random method
- more than 100 - random methods

__decie on sample size__
- 100 samples  & 90% confidence intervals
- 400 samples & 95% confidence intervals
- reserve 15-20%

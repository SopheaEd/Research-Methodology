There xxxx analysis method in qualitative research:
1. Content analysis
2. Thematic analysis
3. Discourse analysis

## Thematic analysis
- identifying patterns
- accessibility & flexibility (codeing and analyzing data systematically)
  - can be conducted in different ways
  - deductive and inductive or theory-driven data coding and analysis
  - an inductive approach to data coding
  - bottom-up approach
  - coding based on content of the data
  - top-down approach
  - thematic maps
 
More experiene analyst will:
  1. likely have _deeper insights_ into their data at a more conceptual level
  2. find the process of coding quicker and easier and be able to code at a more quicker level
  3. more quickly and confidently develop themes that need less reviewing and refining

Cooper et all. 2012 suggested a six-phase approach to thematic analysis: 
1. __Familiarizing Yourself with Data
   - immerse yourself into data (reading & rereading texual data)
     - transcripts of the interviews
     - response to qualitative surveys
     - listening to audio recordings
     - watching vdos data
     - making notes on what you read & listen
     - understand the meaning of the data
2. __Generating Initial Codes__
   - begins the systematic analysis of the data through coding
   - code?
   - theme are the walls
   - roof and your codes are the indvidual bricksand tiles
     - can be segemantic codes
     - can be language or concepts
     - For instance, `not hiding (but not shouting)` stayed close to the participants's language _"I don't make an attempt to hide that I'm gay but at the same time I'm not very forward about it"_
     - codes are succint and work as shorthand for something you, the analyst, understands; do not have to be full worked-up explanations.
     - codes will almost always be a mix of the descriptive and interpretative. [look at the exhibit 4.1]
    
3. __Searching for Themes__
   - A theme "captures sth important about the data in relation to the search question, and prepresents some levels of patterned response or meaning within the data set."
   - Themes are emerging from the data
   - Reviewingn the codes to identify the areas of similarity and overlap of the code
   - Collapsing or clustering codes to identify coherent & meaningfull patterns
   - A lot of codes also clustered around the issue of identiy but did not formm one obvious theme. 
   - Explore the relationship between themes and to consider how themes will work together in thelling an overall story about the data

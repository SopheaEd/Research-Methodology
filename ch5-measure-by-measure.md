## Introduction
- The wall of water that can accompany an earthquake is conveyed in the concept "__tsunami__".
- The rise of sea levels and world temperature are now conveyed via the concept '__climate change__".
- **Concepts** are essential communication tools for communicating.
  - give & receive info effectively
 

## Concepts & the research process
- __Construct__ refers to concepts without empirical counterparts. It is a concept or mental abstraction that is not directly observable.
- __Theory__ is a set of propositions or statements about how the world or some entity operates or works.

## Bring theory down to earth
- __Translation process__ makes the concepts understandable to the empiricist.
- In performing this translation process, the researcher enguages in the measurement process. It converts concepts to variables.
- __Variables__ is empirical representation/indicators of abstract concepts; any trait or characteristic that vary.
- The researcher need to concern about **valid measures** or with achieving measurement validity.
- **Valid measures** refer to measures that actually measure what they claim to measure; measures that docs what hey claim to docs.

## Conceptualization
- The researchers try to achieve conceptual clarity by offering **theoretical (aka norminal) definitions** of concepts.
- **Theoretical (aka nominal or conceptual) definitions** refers to definitions that clarify the exact meaning of concepts being measured by offering synonyms for the concepts; aka dictionary definition.

> Sharpening your research vision: from **concepts** to **conceptual definition** to **variables**
> - Concept: _self-esteem_
>   - conceptual definition: an overall evaluation of one's worth or value
>   - variable: Rosenberg's self-esteem scale
>  - Concept: _shyness_
>    - concept definition: the tendency to feel awkard or tense in social situations
>    - variable: check and buss shyness scale

## Operationalization
- Once a researcher has achieved clarity, she/he can then get on the task of **finding the best empirical counterpart for the concept**.
- **Operationalization process** refer to process of finding __*reasonable*__ and __*accurate*__ impirical indicators for concepts.
- Some measurement ideas are better than others

### Some key guideline for the operationalization process
- Contrive : to invent or create ideas/inidicators
- **Natural measures** refers to no "artifical" or concocted measurement are divised. It naturally occurring evidence by way of empirically documenting a variable.
- It helps to reduce "__Reactivity effeccts__".
- **Reactivity effects** occurs when research participants become aware of the measurement process and consequently change/alter their behaviors as a result.
- **Contrived measures** measures intentionally designed or developed bby the researcher in order to generate empirical evidence of a variable.
  - performance test
  - health check-ups
  - memory tests
  - surveys

 ### Using one or more variables in translating concepts
 - How many variables?
   - depends on how compelx a simple or compelex of the concepts are. 
   - simple concept can be one dimension, and complex concept need multiple dimension.
  - A simple concept can be measured by *__item measures__* while complex concepts require *__composite measures__*.
  - **Item measure** - a single indicator used to document a concept (i.e. one question is typically used to measure gender or age or material status)
  - **Composite measure** refers to a multiple item measure; serveral indicators are used together to measure a complex concept.
    - These multiple item measure are referred to as indexes or scales.
    - provides more valid documentation.
### Levels of measurement
**Measurement** refers to the process by which mumbers are attached to the values of variables (alternate: the process by which abstract concepts are translated into empirical indicators). There are 04 levels of indicators including **nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio**. 
- Measurement envolves a *numerical translation* that is the process by which we attatch nummbers to indictors.
- **Norminal** is once that uses numbers to identify or label the values a variable; aka categorical measure.
- **Ordinal level measure** is one that uses numbers to *rank* order the values of a variable.
  > How would you describe your interest in politics?
  > - No interest
  > - Low
  > - Moderate
  > - High

- **Interval measure** is one that ueses numbers to identify, order and indicate equal distance between the values of a variable. (Learn more here)
- **Ratio level meausure** is one that uses number to express values of variables as real number or counts; aka quantitative measures. 

## Operational definitions
- **Operational definition** helps to define a variable that indicate all of the step requirement to actual measure the variable.
- It gives a detailed statement regarding how variables are or stating full operatal definition.

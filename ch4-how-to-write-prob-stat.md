__PLANNING A RESEARCH PROJECT__

- Find a good research question
  - One that is researchable & interesting
- Conducting a literature review
- The role of theory
  - Deductive vs. inductive research
  - Levels and paradigms
- The kinds of questions
  - Causal questions
  - Non-causal questions
- The time element
  - Here & now: cross-section
  - Overtime to see change: longitudinal
- Validity concerns
  - measurement
  - internal
  - external
## Steps in Research process
__Idea phase - formulate a good research question__
- Review the literature
- State/share your theory
- Ask your questions or state your problem or hypothesis
__Design phase__
- Give your research question/issue, develop an overall design or blueprint for:
  - data collection
  - selecting units of analysis
  - sampling
  - measurement
  - planned analysis
__Analysis phase__
- Select the right statisitcs/technique for answering the research question
___writing/communication phase__
- Share the details as well as the results of your executed study in a well-drafted written report/article


## How to write problem statemment
- To write a research satement, you need to attention and a possible solution
- Problem statement attempt to __fill a gap__ in existing knowledge that requires serious attention.
- Be short 01 or 02 lines
- The rest of the paragraph(s) is its elaboration
  - [ ] cite scholarly reference
- Problem statement should answer to these question:
    - What is the problem? What?
    - Where is the problem? Where?
    - How to solve the problem? **How**?
    - Why you want to solve the problem? **Why**?
    - Is the current problem?

## How to write problem statement by class note
- [ ] Read Ch4 for foundation of the research problem
- [ ] Come up with the right question

Researchable
- answerable
- reasonable
- clear concept
- clear indicators for measuring concept
- good operational definition
- provable by  empirical data
- tangible evidence: sensory evidence, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling
- current scientific methods

Interesting:
- resolving a conflict or debate
- extend questions to new pop or subpop.
- extends questionns

Thinks about units
- Individual
- Households
- Groups
- and more
